 abstract = {Flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) are devices that are used in short duration grid-scale energy storage applications such as frequency regulation and fault protection. The energy storage component of the FESS is a flywheel rotor, which can store mechanical energy as the inertia of a rotating disk. This article explores the interdependence of key rotor design parameters, i.e., shape, operating speed, rotor radius, standby losses, and choice of material, and their influence on the energy storage characteristics of the FESS. Two commercially manufactured metal flywheels with distinct energy storage characteristics are used as case studies to examine the potential benefit of using shape optimization in combination with operating speed, size, and material selection for rotor design. A sequential hybrid optimization strategy that combines a global genetic algorithm with a gradient-based local method is used to solve the rotor shape optimization problem. The choice of an optimal combination of operating speed and rotor radius, together with shape optimization, is demonstrated to provide 21â€“ 46% improvements in the energy capacity of two existing commercial FESS designs. Results show that self discharge losses in the rotor can be reduced by designing optimally shaped rotors with large radii operating at low speeds. It is advantageous, on an ``energy-per-cost of material'' basis, to use steel as the rotor material for optimally shaped flywheels with large radii operated at low speeds. Conversely, aluminium is a better choice of material for flywheels with smaller radii operated at high speeds.},
