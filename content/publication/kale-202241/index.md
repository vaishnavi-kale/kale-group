abstract: Flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) are short to medium duration energy
  storage devices capable of delivering large bursts of power. They are increasingly
  used to reduce the intermittency and improve the reliability of renewable energy
  based electric grids by providing fault protection, frequency regulation, and voltage
  support. Flywheels are mechanical devices that store energy as the inertia of a
  rotating disk. They have lifespans upwards of 20 years, can undergo deep discharge
  without any degradation, and are made of environmentally safe materials. Their cost
  and energy density however, have proven to be barriers to their widespread commercialization
  and deployment. FESS are broadly categorized as low speed FESS, usually made with
  metal rotors, and high speed FESS, usually manufactured with composite rotors. While
  metal rotors utilize their higher mass and moment of inertia to store energy, composite
  rotors, which are relatively lighter than metal rotors, utilize their higher speed
  rather than mass to store energy. Both systems have been analyzed and optimized
  in literature; however, there is no consensus on which system is better suited to
  grid applications. Metal flywheels have a cost advantage over composite flywheels,
  and multiple studies have been done to improve the specific energy of metal rotor
  FESS by optimizing the geometry of the metal rotor by using shape or topology optimization
  methods. This study performs a comprehensive review of FESS utilizing metal rotors
  and their optimal design.
