 abstract = {Flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) are short to medium duration energy storage devices capable of delivering large bursts of power. They are increasingly used to reduce the intermittency and improve the reliability of renewable energy based electric grids by providing fault protection, frequency regulation, and voltage support. Flywheels are mechanical devices that store energy as the inertia of a rotating disk. They have lifespans upwards of 20 years, can undergo deep discharge without any degradation, and are made of environmentally safe materials. Their cost and energy density however, have proven to be barriers to their widespread commercialization and deployment. FESS are broadly categorized as low speed FESS, usually made with metal rotors, and high speed FESS, usually manufactured with composite rotors. While metal rotors utilize their higher mass and moment of inertia to store energy, composite rotors, which are relatively lighter than metal rotors, utilize their higher speed rather than mass to store energy. Both systems have been analyzed and optimized in literature; however, there is no consensus on which system is better suited to grid applications. Metal flywheels have a cost advantage over composite flywheels, and multiple studies have been done to improve the specific energy of metal rotor FESS by optimizing the geometry of the metal rotor by using shape or topology optimization methods. This study performs a comprehensive review of FESS utilizing metal rotors and their optimal design.},
