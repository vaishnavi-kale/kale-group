  abstract = {Flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) are devices that are used in short duration grid-scale energy storage applications such as frequency regulation and fault protection. The energy storage component of the FESS is a flywheel rotor, which can store mechanical energy as the inertia of a rotating disk. This article explores the interdependence of key rotor design parameters, i.e., shape, operating speed, rotor radius, standby losses, and choice of material, and their influence on the energy storage characteristics of the FESS. Two commercially manufactured metal flywheels with distinct energy storage characteristics are used as case studies to examine the potential benefit of using shape optimization in combination with operating speed, size, and material selection for rotor design. A sequential hybrid optimization strategy that combines a global genetic algorithm with a gradient-based local method is used to solve the rotor shape optimization problem. The choice of an optimal combination of operating speed and rotor radius, together with shape optimization, is demonstrated to provide 21\textendash 46\% improvements in the energy capacity of two existing commercial FESS designs. Results show that self discharge losses in the rotor can be reduced by designing optimally shaped rotors with large radii operating at low speeds. It is advantageous, on an ``energy-per-cost of material'' basis, to use steel as the rotor material for optimally shaped flywheels with large radii operated at low speeds. Conversely, aluminium is a better choice of material for flywheels with smaller radii operated at high speeds.},

  abstract = {Flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) are short to medium duration energy storage devices capable of delivering large bursts of power. They are increasingly used to reduce the intermittency and improve the reliability of renewable energy based electric grids by providing fault protection, frequency regulation, and voltage support. Flywheels are mechanical devices that store energy as the inertia of a rotating disk. They have lifespans upwards of 20 years, can undergo deep discharge without any degradation, and are made of environmentally safe materials. Their cost and energy density however, have proven to be barriers to their widespread commercialization and deployment. FESS are broadly categorized as low speed FESS, usually made with metal rotors, and high speed FESS, usually manufactured with composite rotors. While metal rotors utilize their higher mass and moment of inertia to store energy, composite rotors, which are relatively lighter than metal rotors, utilize their higher speed rather than mass to store energy. Both systems have been analyzed and optimized in literature; however, there is no consensus on which system is better suited to grid applications. Metal flywheels have a cost advantage over composite flywheels, and multiple studies have been done to improve the specific energy of metal rotor FESS by optimizing the geometry of the metal rotor by using shape or topology optimization methods. This study performs a comprehensive review of FESS utilizing metal rotors and their optimal design.},

  abstract = {A variable density, stress-constrained topology optimization approach is used, along with the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) power law and a P-norm aggregated global stress measure to optimize the rotor of a flywheel energy storage systems (FESS). A new specific energy maximization optimization formulation is proposed which eliminates the need to impose an arbitrary volume fraction constraint to the optimization problem as it is done in traditional kinetic energy maximization approaches. The FESS rotors obtained with the specific energy formulation achieved a 15.8\% increase in the specific energy compared to the kinetic energy based approach which improved the specific energy by 12.8\%. Factors such as the operating speed, maximum stress, rotational symmetry and rotor material also influence the moment of inertia and stress distribution in the flywheel, and the effects of these parameters on the optimal topology and its energy capacity are investigated. At low speeds, the topology is seen to have elongated holes, which become rounded and move away from central shaft as the speed is increased. The reverse effect is seen when the upper limit on the stress constraint is increased. While the choice of rotor material affects the kinetic energy and mass of the flywheel, its optimal topology and specific energy is seen to be nearly identical for rotor materials with the same E{$\rho$} ratio, and slightly different for other cases. The size of the circular sections used as the topology design domain is seen to affect the number of spokes in the rotor, but the overall specific energy is unaffected, so manufacturing considerations can be used to choose the rotational symmetry of the rotor. Due to the frequent charge\textendash discharge cycles associated with short term storage, both centrifugal and acceleration forces might play an important role in determining the peak stresses in the flywheel. Therefore, the influence of acceleration loads on the optimal rotor topology is also studied and shown to only have an impact for very large instantaneous accelerations of 5235.9 rad/s2 or higher.},
